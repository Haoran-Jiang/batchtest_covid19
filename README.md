## Project Motivation

Prof. Xiaolin Li is inspired by German and Korean pooled sample test for COVID-19. He proposed a quantative way to determine the optimal batch size by the population infection rate. Prof. Hongshik Ahn and his student, Haoran Jiang, are working on the simulation experiment based on Prof. Li's proposals. We want to find a optimal choice among the tradeoff between accuracy and saving of valuable test-kits.
